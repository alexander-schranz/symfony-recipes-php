# Symfony Recipes using PHP Config Files

This repository provides [symfony/recipes-contrib](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib)
using `PHP` instead of YAML files.

The project is using [symplify/config-transformer](https://github.com/symplify/config-transformer)
to convert the `.yaml` config files to `.php` config files. To make 100%
sure you are getting the same recommendation as the official recipes provides.

A big thank you to [TomasVotruba](https://github.com/TomasVotruba) for providing the `symplify/config-transformer`
package and fixing a lot of issues which did make this project even possible.

The converter can be found in the [alexander-schranz/symfony-recipes-yaml-to-php-converter](https://github.com/alexander-schranz/symfony-recipes-yaml-to-php-converter)
repository.
